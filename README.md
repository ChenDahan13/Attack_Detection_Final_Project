# DDOS/DOS Attack Detection Using Machine Learning
## Itroduction
The main goal of the project is to select an article and attempt to achieve different results from it, for better or worse. Our project focuses on the topic above. We selected an article dealing with this issue and tried to obtain our own results using various techniques and algorithms. We worked with the given dataset CIC-IDS2017, concentrating on two segments of the dataset: the files containing traffic data for Wednesdays and Fridays, which are pertinent to our classification problem.
